🚀 **Empowering AtliQ Grand: A Power BI Success Story in Hospitality** 🏨

I'm thrilled to share the successful completion of a transformative Power BI project for AtliQ Grand in the hospitality domain! 🌟

**Background:**
AtliQ Grand, a renowned hotel chain, approached us with a vision to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency. They were eager to harness the power of data to elevate their guest experience and boost profitability.

**Our Mission:**
Stepping in as a dedicated data analyst, I embarked on a journey to revamp AtliQ Grand's data analytics capabilities. With Power BI, I aimed to provide them with real-time insights and actionable information, allowing them to thrive in the competitive hospitality landscape.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

1. **Revenue:** 💰
Power BI enabled AtliQ Grand to track revenue streams comprehensively. The dashboard provides a clear breakdown of revenue sources, helping them allocate resources effectively.

2. **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room):** 🛏️
RevPAR is a critical KPI for the hotel industry. By analyzing RevPAR trends, AtliQ Grand can adjust pricing strategies and marketing efforts in real time.

3. **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):** 📈
DSRN is a metric that quantifies the number of rooms a hotel is able to sell on a given day. With Power BI, AtliQ Grand can monitor this key number.

4. **ADR (Average Daily Rate):** 💲
ADR analysis allows AtliQ Grand to optimize room pricing, ensuring they maximize revenue without compromising occupancy rates.

5. **Realization Percentage:** 📊
This KPI indicates how efficiently AtliQ Grand converts inquiries into bookings. Power BI helps identify bottlenecks in the booking process for immediate action.

6. **Occupancy Percentage:** 🏨
Monitoring occupancy rates in real-time enables AtliQ Grand to offer last-minute promotions and packages, ensuring full utilization of rooms.

7. **Direct Booking Percentage:** 🌐
Power BI has empowered AtliQ Grand to monitor their direct booking percentage. Reducing reliance on third-party platforms enhances profitability and customer relationships.
